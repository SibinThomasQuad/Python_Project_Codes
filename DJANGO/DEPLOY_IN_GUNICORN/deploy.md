Deploying a Django project on a Linux server without Nginx or Apache typically involves running the Django development server or a production-ready server like Gunicorn or Uvicorn behind a reverse proxy. Here are the general steps to deploy a Django project without Nginx or Apache:

**Step 1: Prepare Your Server**

1. **Get a Linux Server**: You'll need a Linux server with SSH access. Popular choices include Ubuntu, CentOS, or any other Linux distribution of your choice.

2. **DNS Configuration**: Set up your DNS to point to your server's IP address if you have a custom domain.

**Step 2: Install Required Software**

1. **Update and Upgrade Packages**:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

   or

   ```
   sudo yum update
   ```

2. **Install Python 3 and pip**:

   For Ubuntu:

   ```
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

   For CentOS:

   ```
   sudo yum install python3 python3-pip
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

**Step 3: Deploy Your Django Project**

1. **Copy Your Project**: Upload your Django project to your server using SCP, SFTP, or any other file transfer method.

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Collect Static Files**:

   ```
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

**Step 4: Run Gunicorn or Uvicorn**

You can use Gunicorn or Uvicorn as a production-ready server to run your Django application. Install it and start your application:

For Gunicorn:

1. Install Gunicorn:

   ```
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. Start Gunicorn:

   ```
   gunicorn your_project.wsgi:application
   ```

For Uvicorn (ASGI application):

1. Install Uvicorn:

   ```
   pip install uvicorn
   ```

2. Start Uvicorn:

   ```
   uvicorn your_project.asgi:application
   ```

**Step 5: Set Up a Reverse Proxy (Optional)**

If you want to access your Django application over HTTP or HTTPS, you can set up a reverse proxy using a tool like Caddy, Traefik, or even Nginx or Apache.

**Step 6: Monitor and Maintain**

Monitor your server for issues, configure log management, perform regular backups, and keep your system and software updated.

It's essential to note that running your Django project using the built-in development server or a production server like Gunicorn or Uvicorn is suitable for development and testing purposes. For a production environment, using a dedicated web server like Nginx or Apache is recommended for security and performance reasons.
