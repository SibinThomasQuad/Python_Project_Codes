Certainly, if you have a large number of URLs and you want to simplify the code, you can define a decorator for your views and apply it to each view. Here's an example:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import user_passes_test
from django.urls import path
from .views import (
    create_moring_trial_status,
    view_moring_trial_status,
    moring_trial_data_json,
    moring_trial_menu,
    moring_trial_detail_view,
)

def user_belongs_to_group(allowed_groups):
    return user_passes_test(lambda user: user.groups.filter(name__in=allowed_groups).exists())

protected_group_decorator = user_belongs_to_group(['group1', 'group2'])

urlpatterns = [
    path('example/path', protected_group_decorator(create_moring_trial_status), name="create_moring_trial_status"),
    
    # Your other URL patterns
]
```

In this example:

- `user_belongs_to_group` is a decorator function that returns the `user_passes_test` decorator with the lambda function checking for group membership.
- `protected_group_decorator` is created using `user_belongs_to_group(['group1', 'group2'])`, which represents the groups you want to check.
- Each view is decorated with `protected_group_decorator`.

This way, you only need to specify the decorator once, making your code more concise. Update the group names in `protected_group_decorator` based on your requirements.
