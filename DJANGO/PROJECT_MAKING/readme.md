Certainly! Here are all the steps to create a simple Django project from scratch, including activating a virtual environment, installing Django, creating a project, setting up an app, configuring URL routing, and creating views and templates. This example will create a project called "myproject" with an app called "myapp":

**Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Linux and Windows)**

**Linux:**

```bash
# Install virtualenv if not already installed
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 2: Install Django**

Inside your activated virtual environment, install Django:

```bash
pip install django
```

**Step 3: Create a Django Project**

Create a new Django project:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

**Step 4: Create a Django App**

Inside your project directory, create a new Django app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

**Step 5: Configure URL Routing (myproject/urls.py)**

In your project's `urls.py`, map URLs to your app's views:

```python
# myproject/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

**Step 6: Create Views (myapp/views.py)**

Define views for your app in the `views.py` file:

```python
# myapp/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")

def my_view(request):
    return render(request, 'myapp/my_template.html')
```

**Step 7: Create Templates (myapp/templates/myapp)**

Create an HTML template for your view. Place it in a directory named after your app (e.g., `myapp/templates/myapp/my_template.html`).

**Step 8: Create URLs for the App (myapp/urls.py)**

Create a `urls.py` file in your app directory and define URL patterns:

```python
# myapp/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello'),
    path('my_view/', views.my_view, name='my_view'),
]
```

**Step 9: Run Migrations**

Run database migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

**Step 10: Create a Superuser (Optional)**

Create a superuser to access the Django admin site:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Step 11: Run the Development Server**

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can access your application at `http://localhost:8000/myapp/hello/` and `http://localhost:8000/myapp/my_view/` to see your views in action.

By following these steps, you've created a simple Django project with basic views, templates, and URL routing. You can further customize and expand your project to suit your needs.
