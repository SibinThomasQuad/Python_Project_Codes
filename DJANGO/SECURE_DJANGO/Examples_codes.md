Certainly, here are some example code snippets that illustrate secure coding practices in Django:

**1. Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection:**
   - Always use Django's QuerySet API, which automatically escapes user inputs to prevent SQL injection.

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   # Good practice: Using QuerySet API
   def get_user_by_username(username):
       return User.objects.filter(username=username).first()

   ```

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
   - Use Django's template system to escape user input to prevent XSS attacks.

   ```html
   <!-- Good practice: Using Django's template system -->
   <p>{{ user_input|safe }}</p>
   ```

**3. Password Hashing:**
   - Use Django's built-in authentication system for password hashing.

   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import User

   # Good practice: Creating a user with a hashed password
   user = User.objects.create_user(username='john', password='secure_password')
   ```

**4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
   - Ensure that CSRF protection is enabled for forms.

   ```html
   <!-- Good practice: Using CSRF token in HTML forms -->
   <form method="post">
       {% csrf_token %}
       <!-- Form fields -->
       <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   </form>
   ```

**5. Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement a Content Security Policy to prevent execution of unsafe scripts.

   ```http
   # Good practice: Adding a Content Security Policy header
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
   ```

**6. Secure File Uploads:**
   - Ensure that user-uploaded files are stored in a non-public directory and that file types are restricted.

   ```python
   # Good practice: Storing uploaded files securely
   class UploadedFile(models.Model):
       file = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/')
   ```

**7. Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization for views and models.

   ```python
   # Good practice: Restricting access to views
   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

   @login_required
   def protected_view(request):
       # View logic
   ```

These examples demonstrate some secure coding practices in Django. It's essential to follow these and other security best practices while developing Django applications to minimize security risks and vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider security audits, regular code reviews, and penetration testing as part of your security strategy to ensure the ongoing security of your application.
