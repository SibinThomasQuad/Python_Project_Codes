To add a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to your Django application, you can follow these steps:

**1. Update Django Settings:**

In your Django project's settings, you can define the CSP policy by setting the `CSP_*` variables in the `MIDDLEWARE` section of your settings. Django's `django-csp` middleware allows you to easily set and enforce a CSP policy. If you don't already have it installed, you can add it to your project:

```bash
pip install django-csp
```

Now, add it to your project's `MIDDLEWARE` setting:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware',
    # ...
]
```

**2. Define Your CSP Policy:**

In your settings, you can define the CSP policy by setting the `CSP_*` variables according to your requirements. Here's an example of a simple CSP policy that only allows resources to be loaded from the same origin:

```python
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_CONNECT_SRC = ("'self'",)
```

This example defines a basic CSP policy that only allows resources to be loaded from the same origin as the site.

You can customize your CSP policy by specifying allowed sources for different content types, such as images (`CSP_IMG_SRC`), scripts (`CSP_SCRIPT_SRC`), styles (`CSP_STYLE_SRC`), and more.

**3. Apply the CSP Middleware:**

After defining your CSP policy in settings, the `CSPMiddleware` will automatically add the CSP header to HTTP responses for all views. The policy will be enforced by the browser when loading resources.

**4. Test Your CSP Policy:**

Once you've configured your CSP policy, it's essential to thoroughly test your application to ensure that all resources are loaded according to the policy. The browser's developer console and its security-related features can be very helpful for diagnosing CSP violations.

**5. Customize and Expand Your Policy:**

CSP policies can become more complex and specific depending on your application's needs. You can include multiple domains and specify how to handle various types of content.

Keep in mind that implementing CSP is a security feature to prevent certain types of attacks. It's important to strike a balance between security and usability and thoroughly test your application after applying CSP headers to ensure it functions as expected.

Remember that a well-configured CSP policy can enhance the security of your web application by mitigating certain types of attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
