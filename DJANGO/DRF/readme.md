Creating a Django REST framework API to manage books with operations like insert, update, delete, search by primary key (PK), and view all involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Set up your Django Project:**
   If you haven't already, create a new Django project and a Django app to hold your book-related code.

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject library_project
   cd library_project
   python manage.py startapp books
   ```

2. **Define the Book Model:**
   In your `books/models.py`, define the Book model to represent your data.

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Book(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       published_date = models.DateField()
   ```

3. **Create Serializers:**
   Create serializers to convert your model data to JSON and vice versa. In `books/serializers.py`:

   ```python
   from rest_framework import serializers
   from .models import Book

   class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = Book
           fields = '__all__'
   ```

4. **Create Views:**
   Create views for various operations (list, create, retrieve, update, destroy). In `books/views.py`:

   ```python
   from rest_framework import viewsets
   from .models import Book
   from .serializers import BookSerializer

   class BookViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
       queryset = Book.objects.all()
       serializer_class = BookSerializer
   ```

5. **Define URLs:**
   Define URL patterns for your API views. In `books/urls.py`:

   ```python
   from rest_framework import routers
   from .views import BookViewSet

   router = routers.DefaultRouter()
   router.register(r'books', BookViewSet)

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', include(router.urls)),
   ]
   ```

6. **Configure URLs in the Project:**
   Include your app's URLs in the project's `urls.py`:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('api/', include('books.urls')),
   ]
   ```

7. **Migrate and Create Superuser:**
   Apply migrations to create the database schema and create a superuser to access the Django admin.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server:**
   Start the development server.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. **Access the API:**
   You can now access your API at `http://localhost:8000/api/books/`. You can use tools like `curl`, `httpie`, or even a web browser to interact with your API.

   - To insert (create) a new book, use the POST request.
   - To update a book, use the PUT or PATCH request with the book's primary key (PK).
   - To delete a book, use the DELETE request with the book's PK.
   - To retrieve a book by PK, simply access `http://localhost:8000/api/books/PK/`.
   - To view all books, access `http://localhost:8000/api/books/`.

Make sure to customize and secure your API as needed, and consider using authentication and permissions based on your project's requirements. This is a basic setup to get you started with a Django REST framework API for managing books.
