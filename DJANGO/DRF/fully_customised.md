Certainly, you can create a Django REST framework (DRF) API with custom views and custom URLs for all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Create a Django Project and App** (if not already done):

   If you haven't already created a Django project and app, you can do so with the following commands:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   cd myproject
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

2. **Define a Model**:

   Create a model in your app's `models.py`. For this example, let's use a `Book` model.

   ```python
   # myapp/models.py

   from django.db import models

   class Book(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       published_date = models.DateField()
   ```

3. **Create Serializers**:

   Create a serializer class in your app's `serializers.py` to convert the model data to JSON and vice versa.

   ```python
   # myapp/serializers.py

   from rest_framework import serializers
   from .models import Book

   class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = Book
           fields = '__all__'
   ```

4. **Create Custom Views**:

   Create custom views in your app's `views.py` to implement the CRUD operations.

   ```python
   # myapp/views.py

   from rest_framework import generics
   from .models import Book
   from .serializers import BookSerializer

   class BookList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
       queryset = Book.objects.all()
       serializer_class = BookSerializer

   class BookDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
       queryset = Book.objects.all()
       serializer_class = BookSerializer
   ```

   In this example, we have two custom views, `BookList` for listing and creating books and `BookDetail` for retrieving, updating, and deleting individual books.

5. **Define Custom URL Patterns**:

   Create URL patterns in your app's `urls.py` to map to your custom views.

   ```python
   # myapp/urls.py

   from django.urls import path
   from .views import BookList, BookDetail

   urlpatterns = [
       path('books/', BookList.as_view(), name='book-list'),
       path('books/<int:pk>/', BookDetail.as_view(), name='book-detail'),
   ]
   ```

6. **Include App URLs in Project URLs**:

   Include your app's URLs in the project's `urls.py`.

   ```python
   # myproject/urls.py

   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('api/', include('myapp.urls')),
   ]
   ```

7. **Migrate and Run the Server**:

   Apply migrations to create the database schema and start the development server.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access Your Custom API**:

   You can now access your custom API at `http://localhost:8000/api/books/` to perform all CRUD operations on book records.

Custom views and URLs allow you to define the behavior of your API endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations according to your project's specific requirements. You can extend these patterns to create additional views and endpoints as needed.
