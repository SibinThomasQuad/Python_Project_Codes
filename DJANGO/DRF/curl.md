You can use the `curl` command to make HTTP requests to the different routes of your Django REST framework API. Here are some examples for the routes we set up in the previous steps:

Assuming your Django development server is running at `http://localhost:8000`, and you're using the provided API routes:

1. **View All Books (GET Request):**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/books/
   ```

2. **Insert a New Book (POST Request):**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/books/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "title": "Sample Book",
       "author": "John Doe",
       "published_date": "2023-10-14"
   }'
   ```

3. **Retrieve a Book by Primary Key (GET Request):**

   Replace `{book_id}` with the actual primary key of the book you want to retrieve.

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/books/{book_id}/
   ```

4. **Update a Book by Primary Key (PUT Request):**

   Replace `{book_id}` with the actual primary key of the book you want to update.

   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/books/{book_id}/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
       "title": "Updated Book Title",
       "author": "Updated Author Name",
       "published_date": "2023-10-15"
   }'
   ```

5. **Delete a Book by Primary Key (DELETE Request):**

   Replace `{book_id}` with the actual primary key of the book you want to delete.

   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/books/{book_id}/
   ```

These `curl` examples assume you have the appropriate permissions and that the API is running on `http://localhost:8000`. Make sure to adjust the URL and data in the requests based on your actual setup and data. Additionally, you may need to include authentication headers or tokens if your API requires authentication.
