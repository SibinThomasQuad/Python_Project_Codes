The error message you're encountering indicates that the `STATIC_ROOT` setting in your Django project's settings (`settings.py`) is not properly configured. The `STATIC_ROOT` setting should be set to the absolute filesystem path where Django will collect and store static files when you run `collectstatic` or when deploying your application. To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. Open your Django project's `settings.py` file.

2. Add or ensure that the `STATIC_ROOT` setting is defined in your `settings.py` and set it to the absolute filesystem path where you want Django to collect and store your static files. For example:

   ```python
   # settings.py

   # Define the URL prefix for static files.
   STATIC_URL = '/static/'

   # Define the absolute filesystem path where collected static files will be stored.
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
   ```

   In this example, `STATIC_ROOT` is set to the 'staticfiles' directory within your project's base directory (`BASE_DIR`). You can choose a different directory if you prefer.

3. After updating the `STATIC_ROOT` setting, save the `settings.py` file.

4. If you've previously run the `collectstatic` command without the proper `STATIC_ROOT` setting, you may need to remove the existing collected static files. Delete the contents of the directory specified by `STATIC_ROOT` or the previously used directory.

5. Run the `collectstatic` command again to collect and store your static files:

   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

This should resolve the "You're using the staticfiles app without having set the STATIC_ROOT setting to a filesystem path" error, and your static files will be collected and stored in the directory specified by `STATIC_ROOT`.
