Yes, there are several alternatives to Daphne for serving ASGI applications in Python. Here are some popular options:

1. **Uvicorn**:
   - Uvicorn is a lightweight ASGI server that is widely used for running asynchronous web applications. It supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and it’s known for its speed and simplicity.
   - You can install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install uvicorn
     ```
   - To run your application, use:
     ```bash
     uvicorn myproject.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

2. **Hypercorn**:
   - Hypercorn is another ASGI server that supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSocket. It can serve ASGI applications and is suitable for production use.
   - Install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install hypercorn
     ```
   - Run it with:
     ```bash
     hypercorn myproject.asgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
     ```

3. **ASGI Lifespan**:
   - Some frameworks or libraries may provide their own servers or tooling. For example, `FastAPI` uses Uvicorn under the hood, and some others may offer specific solutions.

4. **Gunicorn with Uvicorn Worker**:
   - You can use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers to manage multiple instances of your application. This setup can improve performance and scalability.
   - Install Gunicorn:
     ```bash
     pip install gunicorn
     ```
   - Then run:
     ```bash
     gunicorn myproject.asgi:application -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
     ```

### Summary

While Daphne is a solid choice for serving ASGI applications, Uvicorn and Hypercorn are also excellent options that you might consider based on your specific needs. Each server has its own features and performance characteristics, so it’s worth testing them in your particular environment.
