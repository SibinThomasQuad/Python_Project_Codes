ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) are both specifications that define how web servers communicate with web applications, but they are designed for different types of applications and handle concurrency in distinct ways. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)

1. **Synchronous**:
   - WSGI is designed for synchronous web applications. It handles requests in a blocking manner, meaning that a single request is processed at a time per worker.

2. **Threading/Processes**:
   - To handle multiple requests concurrently, WSGI typically relies on multi-threading or multi-processing, where each request may be handled by a separate thread or process.

3. **Use Case**:
   - WSGI is suitable for traditional web applications that do not require long-lived connections or real-time features, such as those built with Django or Flask.

4. **Simpler Model**:
   - The WSGI model is straightforward and easier to understand, making it well-suited for standard web applications.

### ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)

1. **Asynchronous**:
   - ASGI is designed for asynchronous applications, allowing for non-blocking operations. This means that it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without requiring a new thread or process for each request.

2. **Long-lived Connections**:
   - ASGI supports long-lived connections such as WebSockets, enabling real-time features and bidirectional communication.

3. **Use Case**:
   - ASGI is ideal for modern applications that require high concurrency, real-time features (like chat applications), or background tasks, and is commonly used with frameworks like Django Channels, FastAPI, and Starlette.

4. **Complex Model**:
   - The ASGI model can be more complex due to its support for multiple protocols and handling of various types of connections, including HTTP and WebSockets.

### Summary

- **Concurrency**: WSGI is synchronous and handles requests one at a time, while ASGI is asynchronous and can handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Connection Types**: WSGI is designed for standard HTTP requests, whereas ASGI supports long-lived connections and real-time communication (e.g., WebSockets).
- **Use Cases**: WSGI is suitable for traditional web applications, while ASGI is better for modern applications that require real-time features and high concurrency.

In essence, if you're building a standard web application, WSGI may suffice, but for applications that require real-time interactions or high concurrency, ASGI is the better choice.
