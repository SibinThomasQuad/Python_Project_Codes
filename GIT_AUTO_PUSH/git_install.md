The error message you're encountering, "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement git," suggests that you may not have the `git` module installed. The `git` module is not a standard Python package, so you need to install it separately. You can use the `GitPython` library to interact with Git repositories. To install it, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install GitPython
```

Ensure that you have GitPython installed, and then you should be able to use the script I provided in the previous response to automatically commit and push changes to your cloned Git repository.
