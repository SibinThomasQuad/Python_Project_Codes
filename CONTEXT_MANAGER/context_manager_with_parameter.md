To pass parameters to a context manager, you can define a custom class for the context manager and provide an `__init__` method that accepts the parameters. Here's an example:

```python
class CustomContextManager:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2

    def __enter__(self):
        # Perform setup using self.param1 and self.param2
        print(f"Entering the context with parameters: {self.param1}, {self.param2}")
        return self  # You can return any object that you want to use within the "with" block

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        # Perform cleanup
        print("Exiting the context")

# Using the CustomContextManager with parameters
param_value1 = "Hello"
param_value2 = 42

with CustomContextManager(param_value1, param_value2) as my_context:
    # Code inside the "with" block
    print(f"Doing something with parameters: {my_context.param1}, {my_context.param2}")

# Exiting the context automatically
```

In this example:

- The `CustomContextManager` class takes two parameters (`param1` and `param2`) in its `__init__` method.
- When you use the context manager with the `with` statement, you pass the values for `param1` and `param2` in the constructor (`CustomContextManager(param_value1, param_value2)`).
- The `__enter__` method can access these parameters as attributes of the instance (`self.param1` and `self.param2`).
- The `__exit__` method is responsible for cleanup actions.

When the "with" block is entered, the `__enter__` method is called with the provided parameters, and when the block is exited, the `__exit__` method is called for cleanup.

Adjust the parameters and their usage in the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods based on the specific needs of your context manager.
