Generators in Python are a way to create iterators with a more concise and memory-efficient syntax. They allow you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without loading the entire sequence into memory. This is especially useful for dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

In Python, generators are created using functions with the `yield` statement. The function, when called, returns a generator object, and the code inside the function is not executed immediately. Instead, it is executed when the generator's `__next__()` method is called, allowing you to generate and yield values one at a time.

Here's a simple example of a generator function:

```python
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Using the generator
gen = simple_generator()

print(next(gen))  # Output: 1
print(next(gen))  # Output: 2
print(next(gen))  # Output: 3
# If you call next() again, it will raise StopIteration because there are no more values
```

In this example, `simple_generator()` is a generator function that yields three values. When you call `next()` on the generator object, the function executes until it encounters a `yield` statement, and the yielded value is returned. The state of the function is saved, allowing it to resume execution from the last `yield` when `next()` is called again.

Generators are useful for tasks like reading large files line by line, generating sequences of numbers, and other scenarios where you want to produce values on-the-fly without loading the entire dataset into memory.

Here's an example of a generator that generates an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers:

```python
def fibonacci_generator():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator
fib_gen = fibonacci_generator()

for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fib_gen))
# Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
```

This generator produces Fibonacci numbers one at a time without calculating the entire sequence in advance.
